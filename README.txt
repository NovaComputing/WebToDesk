The current status of this project:

currently this is nothing more than a terminal tool which will auto launch
web pages for you in seprate windows. It is very basic right now, but there
are much more elegant things planned to come.

What is the ideal next step:

Next step would be to set this program up so that it is a fork of the firefox
and the chromium web browsers. There would be two options for people to download
and in the fork a lot of end user functionality would be stripped and more 
support architectures would be added. What I mean by support architectures is 
that the web site or application would act and behave more like a desktop application
and with more use of cache files. Eventaully the goal is that the program can 
"learn" meaning as you use a website it can use the code it is being sent
in order to show you the exact UI and the "learning" part will be that the 
program will make a offline version of the website locally cached.
What that means for you is that you eventually will be able to take some
(not all) of your favorite websites with you on the go offline. (obviously
websites like reddit which need internet connections will be useless) offering
a fork of both firefox and chromium will allow the end user to choose the experience
they are most comfortable with.

Why Should You Use WebToDesk:

In its current functionality, Web to desk can save a lot of space in pointless
desktop shortcuts that take up more spaces than this program does. When the program
is moved to its next stage support for google drive, dropbox, MS OneDrive, and others
will be added nativly into the solution allowing users data to be streamed either
directly to their favorite medium or downloaded like normal. Functionality like
this will greatly benefit Linux users who do not currently have a MS office sutie
which cannot (simply) be installed without the use of wine. This soultion will
fake being a end user installed program and through a lot of file caching it will
allow for websites to look and behave like installed programs

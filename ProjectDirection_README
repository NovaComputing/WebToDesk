Welcome!


Every great project starts with a solid road map. This will be a living document and I will 
be committing changes to it to reflect the project and the times. The project is released
currently with the Ubuntu/Debian file system accounted for in the admitidly primative install
script. This piece of software is released under the GNU GPL V.2 and by such is free software.
In order to get around using proprietary software on your system one can used this portal to
"use" the software, but still free themselves from the closed source software.

Goal:

Currently this program is written in Python, Python is a fine language, but it also uses
firefox to just launch the programs. I want to add a few more features to the program to
make it more flexable before exploring other platforms. I want to eventually have a browser
like program that is capable of reading, parsing, and processing scripting languages which
will load up a few windows at a time, but will look as if it were a standalone program and
not a browser. Forking a light weight browser in order to provide functionality with a different
end experience. Python may or may not be the end language used, but it is the current option.

Planned features:

Support to choose which trigger word(s) launch which websites.
Support for exported files to be uploaded to a cloud service of the end users choice
            ie: Google Drive, Drop Box, One Drive, A possible opensource solution from us
Support for cross platforms(should be a given)
